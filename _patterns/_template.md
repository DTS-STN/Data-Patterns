    <div class="panel panel-default pattern-demo">
        <div class="panel-body">
            <p class="h2 mrgn-tp-sm">Part 1 example</p>
            <p>Show what it would look like with an example and include a code snippet of what's actually being done to achieve it!</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <details>
        <summary>Code</summary>
