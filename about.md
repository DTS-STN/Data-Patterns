## What are data patterns?

Patterns are like building blocks for service design.
By creating patterns, we create a repeatable way of doing something.
We can make sure something looks, feels, and functions the same way, so we clearly understand what weâ€™re doing, whenever or wherever we do it.

Data patterns focus on repeatable interactions involving data flows such as giving or withdrawing consent, accessing data, or understanding an automated decision.
They bring together design, technical, and policy components to give a view of what is happening with people's data from the front-end to the back-end, and back again.

## How can I use a pattern?

The different pattern components are meant to serve different users (service designers, developers, policy experts, researchers, etc.), usually within a team.

Check out our [template (on GitHub)](https://github.com/DTS-STN/Data-Patterns/blob/main/_patterns/_template.md) for descriptions of those components or guidance to start developing your own pattern.

Before using a pattern, you should also check the pattern's status via `{{ page.status }}` or the alert banner under the pattern's title on a webpage.

If a pattern is **in development**, that means it's an emerging idea and we're still working out how to implement it.
We encourage you to test it and share your feedback to help make it ready for use.

If it's **in use**, it's already a part of our services and ready to be re-used in other contexts.
We encourage you to use it, measure how it works, and share your feedback to improve it.
